/*
 * Create a module called 'prodDir'
 * Define a directive on it called 'showInventory'
 * The directive should be restricted to being an attribute and should
 * render the content 'Inventory value: $inventory_value'
 * (Which is currently in partials/product-detail-tpl.html)
 * You will need to pass in an object's worth of data to render a result
 * (Hint, a product object.)
 */

/*
 * Part II: Add a directive called navButtons
 * It will have a dependency on the $location service
 * It should be an element, and accept three attributes: collection, item
 * and idProp
 * Define a link function, which is where you will add the event handlers
 * set up in partials/nav-buttons-tpl.html
 *
